Vision: The Future of AI Interaction is Structured
Welcome to the experimental repository for the Prompt Engineering workshop at AI Experience 2025.
Our mission is to build a virtual testing environment to demonstrate and quantify a central thesis: the effectiveness of an Artificial Intelligence model is intrinsically linked to the quality and structure of the prompts that guide it.
This project arises from the need to move AI interaction from an abstract art to an applied science.

The Challenge: From Ambiguity to Precision
Interactions with generic or poorly designed prompts result in unpredictable, inconsistent, and often low-quality outputs.
To unlock AI’s true potential, we need methods that guarantee clarity, context, and control.

The Methodology: A Three-Pillar Benchmark
This experiment will create a rigorous benchmark, systematically comparing the results of different AI models under three distinct conditions:

Generic Prompts: We will simulate common, vague, and under-specified interactions to establish a performance baseline.

Structured Prompts (Advanced Methods): We will implement and evaluate two high-performance methodologies:

JSON Prompt: A format that structures the request as a data object, forcing the AI to think more logically and coherently.

Kernel Prompt: An approach that encapsulates complex instructions, examples, and constraints within a cohesive “kernel,” guiding the model with maximum precision.

Prompt Libraries: We will analyze the performance of an established commercial prompt library as an external reference point.

The Legacy: An Open Resource for the Community
All test scripts, prompts used, model-generated results, and comparative analyses will be versioned and made publicly available in this repository.

The ultimate goal is twofold:

Practical Demonstration: To serve as the primary demonstration tool during the workshop, showcasing unequivocally the power of prompt engineering.

Long-Term Resource: To create a valuable asset for the community, enabling other developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to use our findings to enhance their own AI interactions.
